 ###
 - Note:
 This playground is intended to be read by adults only.
 
 In 1978 Louise Brown became the first baby born by IVF (In Vitro Fertilization). Her birth revolutionized the field of reproductive medicin. Giving that approximately 1 in 8 heterossexual couples has difficult in conceiving and that homossexual couples and single parents often need clinical help to make a baby the demand for IVF has been growing.
 ###
 This playground wants to demystify the proccess of IVF and explain the step by step of how it works. I wanted to make it easy for people who need it to understand how it works, and encourage them to do it and realize their dream of parenthood.
