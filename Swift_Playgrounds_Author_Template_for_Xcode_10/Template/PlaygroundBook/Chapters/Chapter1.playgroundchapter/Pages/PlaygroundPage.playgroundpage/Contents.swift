 ###
 In 1978 Louise Brown became the first baby born by IVF (In Vitro Fertilization). Her birth revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Giving that approximately 1 in 8 heterossexual couples has difficult in conceiving and that homossexual couples and single parents often need clinical help to make a baby, the demand for IVF has been growing.
