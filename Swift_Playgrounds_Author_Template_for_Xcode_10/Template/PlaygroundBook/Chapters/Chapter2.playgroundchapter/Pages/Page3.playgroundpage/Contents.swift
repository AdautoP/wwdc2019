 # Fertilization
 ## Natural Fertilization
 
 ###
 The first type of fertilization is the natural one. In case the sample of sperm is healthy enough, all that need to be done is incubate the ovule with the sperm on a favorable solution and let the fertilization occur.
 
 - Note:
 The ovule produces a chemical that attracts the sperm. Try moving the ovule, the sperm will always try to reach it.
 
 ## Manual Fertilization
 ###
 On the cases where the sperm is not healthy enough, manual fertilization is required. It consists on using a needle to inject the sperm directly inside the ovule.
 ###
 Try injecting the sperm inside the ovule using the command below:
 - Example:
 manualInjection()
