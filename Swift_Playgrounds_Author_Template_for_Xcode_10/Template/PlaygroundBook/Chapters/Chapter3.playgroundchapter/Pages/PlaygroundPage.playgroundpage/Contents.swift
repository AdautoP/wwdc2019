 # Myself
 ###
 My name is Adauto Fernan Távora Pinheiro, I'm 24 years old. I'm currently a Computer Engineering Student and an Apple Developer Academy Student. I've been an Apple Developer Academy student for about 1 year now.
 I love to code, play online games and watch tv shows. I love my family, my animals and my girlfriend, in fact, she is the main reason I chose this theme for this playground.

 # Motivation
 ###
 My girlfriend Beatriz studies Biomedicine and wants to specialize in Assisted Reproductive Technology. I wanted to mix my area of study (software development) with hers so we talked about and found out that In Vitro Fertilization is really important for the society, so I chose to talk about it.
